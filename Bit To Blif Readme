How to build a blif file from the bitstream:

You can call the script 
>example/extract_logic_function.sh bitstream.mif output.blif HasClock HasReset

where the bitstream.mif is the bitstream you want to build your blif from
output.blif the name of the blif file you want to create 
and HasClock and HasReset are two booleans [True/False] which indicate that the circuit use a clock or a reset signal.
Those two signal properties can not be read out from the bitstream so we have to
specify them.

Also you must provide the same zuma_config.py architecture description to the script,
as you use to build the bitstream.mif because the architecture details 
can not be read out from the bitstreamm too.
